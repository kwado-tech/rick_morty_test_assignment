Test Task: Online Casino Flutter application

Do you remember Rick and Morty cartoon?
Your goal is to create the app with all the characters from this cartoon, and make it look juicy.

API docs: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

To-do:
- Fix loading state and fetching data logic
- Find and fix all other issues
- Add more information about characters
- Optimize scrolling performance
- Implement pagination


Optional:
Add infinite scrolling pagination.

PS: You need to use same libraries, but you can also add more (reasonable amount).

This was an exciting challenge and am glad to be part of it.

Listed below, are my updates and feature implementations
- Fixed application crash on launch,
- Redesigned UI (added details screen),
- Refactored codebase (went minimal)
- Handled internet connection availability checks,
- Used functional programming concepts to properly propagate my exception handling
- Implemented infinity scroll.

Packages used
- cached_network_image (cache network image)
- dartz (functional programming concepts)
- fluttertoast (exception notification as side-effect)
- freezed (aid union classes and inheritance)
- internet_connection_checker (internet connection checks)
- provider (snapshot cache)
- timeago (nice time-range display)

PS. Couldn't go with TDD as limited time was a factor working on this
